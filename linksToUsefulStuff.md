# Very Useful Online Tools that I Personally Use
### This list contains some of the online resources I use to build my apps. The softwares that I download and use often are in a different file.

## For Web Design (front end)
- [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) <br> I don't use Figma much for solo projects that I work on by myself, but if I have to present a manifest to a team, I willl use Figma to supplement and help others better visualise the pipelines.
- [Lummi](https://www.lummi.ai/) <br> For downloading free HD 4K/8K ultra-realistic AI pictures and 3D models
- [Spline](https://spline.design/) <br> Online tool to render quality 3D models, a quick subsitute for Blender or Maya assets.

## For Debugging 
- [JsonPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/guide/) <br> API for Spoofing CRUD functions and fetching JSON-formatted strings
- [LoremPicsum](https://picsum.photos/) <br> For API links to high-quality placeholder images while prototyping

## Gamified Learning 
- [cssBattle](https://cssbattle.dev/) <br> CSS game to train Readability and Efficiency
- [SQL Noir](https://www.sqlnoir.com/) <br> Even till today, I enjoy this game a lot! A detective crime solving game with clues hidden in databases
